<div id="aboutme-section">

Hello and welcome to my blog! I am a security professional with expertise in vulnerability management, particularly with Tenable SC, WAS, IO, and NNM, as well as Qualys and limited experience with other solutions. In addition to vulnerability management, I am a network security expert with experience in multiple network security vendors such as Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Forcepoint.

I have a passion for technology and infosec, and I am always eager to learn more and stay current with the latest developments in the field. I believe in giving back to the community, and I have contributed to the open-source community through my work and projects.

With years of experience in architecture review, I have a strong understanding of the importance of security in all aspects of technology, from the design phase to the implementation and maintenance phases. I have hands-on experience in Linux, pentesting, SIEM solutions such as LogRhythm and GRC.

I am excited to be starting this blog and sharing my knowledge and experiences with you. I am looking forward to continuing to grow and evolve as a security professional, and I hope that this blog will be a valuable resource for others in the field. Whether you are a seasoned security expert or just starting out, I hope you will find the content on this blog informative and engaging.
